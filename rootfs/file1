Welcome
I am an assistant professor in the department of computer science at National Chiao Tung University. My research work spans computer architecture, computer systems, and programming languages.
I am always looking for undergraduate and graduate students excited about the research in computer architecture, systems, and programming languages. Please email me with a copy of your resume or CV if you are interested in working with me.
